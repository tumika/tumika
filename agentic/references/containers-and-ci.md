# Containers and CI

## Containers

Two images, and they are not interchangeable (ADR: D9):

- **`deploy/Dockerfile`** — what a user runs. One process, `tumika` as PID 1, logs
  on stdout, restart policy left to the orchestrator. No service manager, no
  `tumika install`. Runs as an unprivileged account with `/var/lib/tumika` as the
  only volume.
- **`deploy/testharness/Dockerfile`** — CI only. A real systemd, so `tumika
  install` is *exercised* rather than asserted about.

Both are exercised by a script rather than merely built, because a Dockerfile
that parses proves nothing. `verify-image.sh` checks that the binary runs on that
base, that an unprivileged account can write a fresh volume, that the documented
two-step first run works (`token rotate`, then `serve` — the daemon refuses to
serve without a token), that `/v1/health` answers through a published port, that
the token never reaches the logs, and that state survives a restart.

The API binds loopback by default, which inside a container means unreachable.
That is deliberate — it carries a bearer token in clear text — so publishing a
port also means passing `--listen`, and the daemon logs a warning when you do.

## CI

`cross-compile` builds all four release targets. Nothing else does: `build &
test` compiles for whatever the runner is, and tumika is written for a Pi.

Its `no cgo` step is the real enforcement of the no-cgo invariant. `source/daemon/.golangci.yml`
has a `nocgo` depguard rule that **documents intent and enforces nothing** —
depguard never sees `import "C"`, in either cgo mode. And
`CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` does not catch it either: build constraints
exclude the file, the pattern match skips the package, and the build exits zero.
Both were verified by adding a cgo package. `go list` reporting a non-empty
`CgoFiles` is what actually fires.
